There are a lot of cables in the market that may suit the requirements of one gamer but not the other. So it completely depends upon personal preferences. However, there are some general features that you must look out for in a cable while buying it to upgrade your gaming experience.\\n\\nWith our buyer guide, you will be able to easily reach out to the best Ethernet Cable in the market that could provide you the best results with enhanced performance. Let’s get started!\\n\\n#### Category of the Cable\\n\\nTo get the best Ethernet Cable for yourself, make sure to explore the category of the cable that you would need for the best results. It is one of the most important things to do before spending your money on buying the cable, as any mistake in choosing the wrong cable can make you regret your choice for life.\\n\\nThere are many categories of cable in the market that perform different functions and are best suited to certain specific needs. When you want an Ethernet cable for gaming purposes, then we would recommend you to go for Cat-5e and Cat 6, whichever is more convenient buying for you. But if you already have a very high-speed internet connection at your home, then, to support it, you can go for buying Cat-7 and Cat-8, which are much better in their performance and manufacturing than other cables.\\n\\nTo look out for the category of the cable, you can simply check out the specifications of the cable. The categories of the cable are mentioned on the cable, so it would be very easy for you to detect the category of the cable.\\n\\n#### Material\\n\\nNone of the gamers would ever deny the fact that manufacturing material greatly affects the performance of the cable, and neither do we. So we prefer you not to avoid looking for the material of which the cable is made because there are some materials which can make your buying experience worse by irritating you with their unsatisfactory performance.\\n\\nTo avoid such problems, what you can do is figure out the type of installation you want of the cable. If you want to install it outdoors, then it must have the materials that could bear out the changing weather and if you would be installing the cable indoors, then choose the Ethernet cable that will provide you maximum protection against the electricity.\\n\\n#### Cable Type\\n\\nNot leaving out of our list, here is another most important feature that you should consider while buying the best Ethernet Cable For Gaming purposes: the type of cable. It is an important feature that is going to greatly affect your gameplay.\\n\\nThese Ethernet cables have four types: STP, FTP, UTP, and SFTP. All of these cables are perfect for different types of connections, like UTP does not come with copper cables and is used for basic connections between a computer and a modem and many other electronic devices. So all you have to check out first is which type of connection do you want, then purchase the type of cable accordingly.\\n\\n#### Speed\\n\\nObviously, you are not spending extra money because you want a cable that doesn’t provide you enough speed to enjoy your gaming experience, right? Gamers are specifically concerned about the speed of their internet connection, which helps them be more enthusiastic in their online game for a longer period of time. If you are one of such gamers, then this feature is the most important for you to consider.\\n\\nIf you have a strong internet connection and your modem is already advanced to provide you with much faster speed, then make sure to buy a cable that can perfectly support your modems and routers. For such purposes, make sure to buy the cable that is latest and advanced, like Cat-8 or Cat-6e.\\n\\nThese cables are made of high-quality material that works perfectly well when connected to the best-performing modems and routers. These cables are shielded to prevent electromagnetic interference. These cables are worth spending the money and provide you benefit for the longer-term.\\n\\n#### Device Compatibility\\n\\nThis feature is also important and is individual specific. Before categorizing an Ethernet cable as best depending upon its other features, make sure to know what type of cable does your device accepts. Many great quality cables that have been highly rated and recommended by millions of users are not compatible with the devices of some. So it’s always about the compatibility that you have to be sure about before buying the cable for you.\\n\\nSome Ethernet cables offer a wide choice for connectivity and are compatible with various devices and Ethernet cables. So, if you are choosing an Ethernet cable depending upon the compatibility options, you should make sure that the Ethernet cable you buy is compatible with a wide range of devices as it would be very easier for you to connect it to them; otherwise, you would have to spend extra money to buy additional Ethernet cables for almost all of your devices.\\n\\n#### Shielding\\n\\nEthernet cables are perfectly shielded with good quality material that reduces interference, but still, there is a lot of difference among the types of shielding for different cables.\\n\\nTypically, foil wrapping is a good choice to go for as it is bound around each twisted pair of wire in the cable and helps reduce the crosstalk and external noises or signal pollution. However, there are still some advanced versions of foil wrapping where the inner layer of the cable is also wrapped up to provide its maximum protection against signal loss and latency.\\n\\nSo now we are relaxed that we have reached out to you with maximum points that are perfectly simple, even then affect your cable purchase greatly. So, keep these things in mind if you want to have an exclusive and memorable experience with your cable devices and connection.\\n\\n### Final Verdict\\n\\nNo cables in the market are as efficient as these Ethernet cables are. Manufactured with advanced and upgraded features, these above-mentioned cables are now included in the top 10 **best Ethernet cable for gaming** list. Everyone who uses the internet has his own requirements for the connections, but gamers are a little more difficult to satisfy. They need a much faster internet connection, almost 0% interference, and minimal latency so that they can enjoy their favorite game without any interruption and irritation. So, these Ethernet cables are designed especially to satisfy the gaming needs of the gamers and are now greatly admired among the gaming community for their high-quality performance and great results.\",\n  \"sidebar\": {\n    \"stoc\": [{\n      \"level\": false,\n      \"name\": \"DbillionDa - Best Ethernet Cable For Gaming Cat 8\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"GLANICS - Best Ethernet Cable For Streaming Cat 8\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"ASUS All in One DOCSIS 3.0 Comcast's Xfinity Compatibility\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"Jadaol Cat 7\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"Vandesail Cat 7 High Speed STP\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"InstallerParts Cat-6A UTP Booted\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"Mediabridge Cat-5e - Best Dual Support Cable\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"Jadaol - Best Ethernet Cable For Gaming Cat 6\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"GearIt Cat-5e\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"Cable Matters 8-Color Combo\"\n    }, {\n      \"level\": true,\n      \"name\": \"Monoprice Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable\"\n    }],\n    \"stitle\": \"Editor's Choice\",\n    \"atext\": \"DbillionDa Cat 8\",\n    \"alink\": \"https://amzn.to/3o77eC8\",\n    \"image\": \"/img/dbillionda-cat-8-ethernet-cable.webp\"\n  },\n  \"faq\": [{\n    \"ques\": \"Why are the Ethernet cables good to use?\",\n    \"ans\": \"You are going to have a great experience if you are planning to install the Ethernet cables in your smart homes.

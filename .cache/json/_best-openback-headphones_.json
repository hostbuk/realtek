Good material and good gaming headsets give you an additional benefit over your competitor and make you stand.\\n\\nBut how to know whether the headsets you are going to purchase are of good quality and meet your requirements or not?\\n\\nTo have a deeper knowledge of different gaming headsets to know whether they best suit you or not, you might not want to try all of them one by one to find the answer. But, the best way you would go is to know your own preferences first and then search them out. Because, for a passionate gamer, the best headset is all that a gamer needs.\\n\\nNone of the headsets is good or bad. Rather it all depends upon your own personal preferences. One headset may be suitable for some else but not you and vice versa. However, the following are the most important features that you must not miss out on checking while searching out for the best gaming headset for you.\\n\\n#### Check Compatibility\\n\\nBefore purchasing any headset, you must know on what platform you are going to use it. If you are an Xbox lover and prefer playing games on it, then you must make sure that whether the headset you have eyed is compatible with Xbox or not? And likewise, if you use consoles, PCs, etc.\\n\\nHowever, Mac users often face difficulty in finding headsets that are compatible with Apple devices. But there are some companies out there whose headsets are highly compatible with Apple devices, and the rest are working hard to solve the problems.\\n\\nSome headphones are compatible with all the platforms, but they are quite expensive.\\n\\n#### Check connection type\\n\\nThe most important thing you need to consider in headphones while finding out their compatibility with your desired platform is to check their type of connection. If you are a PS4 lover, you are not going to face any connectivity issue, but if you are a PC lover, then you must have to go deeper into this matter.\\n\\nHeadsets that are specifically designed for PCs ask you to install and additional software that allows you to access advanced features of the headphones like surround sound etc.\\n\\nThere are several types of connections: standard 3.5mm, dual 3.5mm, wired USB, wireless USB, and Bluetooth.\\n\\n#### Wide Compatibility\\n\\nHeadphones specifically designed for Xbox ask for tricky access to be compatible with it. The wireless USB headsets can be even trickier. Newer Xbox One comes with a 3.5mm jack for standard headsets bug; if you have an old Xbox, you need to buy an adapter to connect your headset with your Xbox.\\n\\nThese USB wireless USB models are compatible with PS4 and PC’s and in some cases with Xbox One also. On the other hand, Bluetooth headphones connect with mobile devices, PS4, PS Vita, and PC.\\n\\n#### Prioritize your comfort\\n\\nThe other thing that you need to keep in mind while buying the best headphones for gaming is to see where they are comfortable for hours of long play or not.\\n\\nGood headsets are essential for gaming, and if your headphones are not providing you comfort during the game time, then they not only add extra pressure on your ears but also badly affect your gaming experience.\\n\\nGood headsets are lightweight and featured with good, premium quality material that provides you exceptional comfort, reduces pain in your ears, neck, and head, and is more reliable and durable.\\n\\nSo, better to think twice before buying than to regret the wasteful thing.\\n\\n#### Check the material of Earpads and Headband.\\n\\nComfort is the basic requirement that any gamer should take into mind while buying the best headsets for gaming.\\n\\nThe material and design of headphones must be in a way that they do not hurt your ears and head even when you wear them for a prolonged period of time.\\n\\nAs for the earpads, leather material is ever best comfortable for ears than any other material.\\n\\nAnd for the headband, make sure that it rests well on your head. Make sure to buy padded headbands- that provide you comfort–instead of plastic or metal ones.\\n\\n#### Weight\\n\\nWeight is another most crucial factor that you must keep in mind while purchasing beast headsets for gaming purposes. Now the question is, what about weight is needed to be considered?\\n\\nWell, to answer that, we would say that make sure that your headsets be lightweight. Because if those would be too heavy, you would not only be prone to comfort-related problems like headache and neckache, but your game will also be affected badly.\\n\\n#### Microphone Quality\\n\\nThe first and foremost thing to see in the microphone of a headphone is that it should be in-built and specified for gaming.\\n\\nMicrophone helps you to communicate with your friends while gaming. A good headset is accompanied by a microphone that is designed with more cancelation feature filters your voice and make for others who hear it.\\n\\nMore clear and remarkably audible.\\n\\nFurthermore, if you are stuck with the choice to choose between omnidirectional mic. or uni-directional mic, then go for the latter as it further clear and filters the sound.\\n\\n#### Durability\\n\\nWhether you are looking for an expensive headset or on a low budget, the most important thing about the headset that you should never compromise on is its durability. Make sure that you do not buy cheap material headsets that would not stay for long.\\n\\n#### Sound Quality\\n\\nA gamer is perfectly aware of how a high-quality sound can make all the difference in their gaming. Headsets that you buy for gaming purposes must always give you perfect sound quality, which should enable you to hear explosions and gunfire within the game and even the footsteps and moves of your enemy.\\n\\nSo make sure to buy headphones that provide you with an exceptionally premium sound quality.\\n\\n#### Wired or Wireless Headsets\\n\\nit completely depends upon your personal preferences that whether you prefer wired headphones over wireless or vice versa.\\n\\nBut to keep in mind is that either of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. Wired headphones mostly get tangled and get you into the hassle of untangling the wire time and again.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the wired headsets, which save you from the above-mentioned trouble, but they connect to your platform through Bluetooth or wireless networks that may cause some connection problem. However, many companies are working hard to overcome this issue and will soon resolve it.\\n\\n#### Price Range\\n\\nNow the question comes, how much should you spend on a headset? A quality headset ranges from $50-$100. But some are expensive and provide you with better features and functions. It entirely depends upon you that how much you want to spend on a headset.\\n\\nNow you have all the information of what you have to keep in mind while buying the best headset for gaming purposes, and now you may choose any of the headsets and search for the qualities you want in them the most purchase to have a great gaming experience.\\n\\n### Final Verdict\\n\\nSo gamers, we hope now you have the knowledge of all the brands and of all the things that you must consider while buying the **best open back headphones for gaming** purposes.
